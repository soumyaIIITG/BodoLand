Run the rf_onbodo.ipynb, knn.ipynb, logit.ipynb, svc.ipynb to get the accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score of the LLM-ARFE, KNN, LR, and SVC models, respectively. Code for ROC and PR for each model can be found in their respective files.

Run the diff_noise_lvl_and_varying_dataset.ipynb to see the variation in accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score of all the models on varying the noise level and changing the dataset size.
