new_synthetic_data_credit_assigned.csv is the synthesized version of the original dataset that was made from the field visit in the Bodoland Territirial Region (BTR) of Assam.

Run the rf_onbodo.ipynb, knn.ipynb, logit.ipynb, svc.ipynb to get the accuracy, precision, recall, f1-score of the LLM-ARFE, KNN, LR, SVC models respectively. ROC and PR for each models can be found in their respective file.

Run the diff_noise_lvl_and_varying_dataset.ipynb to see the variation in accuracy, precision, recall, f1-score of all the models on varying the noise level and changing the dataset size.
